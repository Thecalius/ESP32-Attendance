#ESP32 RFID Attendance System
This project is an attendance system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an RFID-RC522 module. By tapping an RFID tag, users can clock in and clock out. The data is sent to a Flask server, which logs the attendance information.

Introduction
This project provides a simple and efficient way to track attendance using an RFID tag and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system logs clock-in and clock-out times on a Flask server and can be extended to include more advanced features.

Hardware Requirements
ESP32 microcontroller
RFID-RC522 module
RFID tags
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (e.g., USB cable)
Software Requirements
Python 3.x (for running the Flask server)
Flask (Python web framework)
PlatformIO (for building and uploading code to ESP32)
VS Code (recommended IDE)
Arduino IDE (optional)
Installation and Setup
Cloning the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-rfid-attendance.git
cd esp32-rfid-attendance
Setting Up the Flask Server
Navigate to the Flask server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install the required Python packages:

You can install the dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the index.html file is placed in the templates folder:

The Flask server requires an index.html file to serve the web interface. This file should be located in a templates directory within the same folder as server.py.

Run the Flask server:

Start the server by running:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
The server will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Configuring the ESP32 Code
Open the project in VS Code with PlatformIO:

Launch VS Code, and open the project folder.

Update the Wi-Fi credentials:

In the ESP32 code, find and modify the following lines to match your Wi-Fi network name and password:

cpp
Copy code
const char* ssid = "Your Network Name";  // Network's name (Service Set Identifier)
const char* wifi_password = "Your Wi-Fi Password"; 
Ensure the correct port and board are selected:

Make sure your ESP32 board is properly selected in PlatformIO, and the correct port is chosen for uploading the code.

Building and Uploading Code to ESP32
Build the project:

In VS Code with PlatformIO, click on the "PlatformIO: Build" button in the bottom bar or run:

bash
Copy code
platformio run
Upload the code to ESP32:

Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB and click the "PlatformIO: Upload" button, or run:

bash
Copy code
platformio run --target upload
The code will be compiled and uploaded to your ESP32 board.

Usage
Power on the ESP32 and ensure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.
Tap an RFID tag on the RC522 module.
The ESP32 will send the RFID data to the Flask server, which logs the clock-in or clock-out time.
